# Group8-Shop_Till_You_Want

## Project Title: Shop Till You Want 
### Abstract:
#### • E-Commerce is process of doing business through computers.
#### • A user can easily access all the facilities of the Internet to buy or sell the products.
#### • Unlike traditional commerce that is carried out physically with effort of a person to go & get products, ecommerce has made it easier for      human to reduce physical work and to save time.
#### • User can browse online shops, compare prices and order merchandise sitting at home on their PC.
#### • To achieve this we used Java Full Stack to develop an ecommerce like our existing system SHOP FOR HOME.
#### • We used angular for developing the frontend part and java spring boot for backend and to store the data we used postgreSQL.
###  • We have also used MojoAuth for Implementing Authentication through mail service (OTP/ Link).
